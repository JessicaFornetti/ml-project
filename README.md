# ml-project

This project provides a comparison of different supervised learning models to predict churn behavior/fraud/customer attrition on 3 different datasets dealing with unbalanced data.

The project uses the following datasets from Kaggle :

- [Credit Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/code/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets)
- [Bank Marketing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing-imbalanced-dataset-94)
- [Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/junglisher/employee-attrition-analysis/input) 

The main steps of the project are outlined below, each session was conducted in a seperate notebook:

- **Session 1 - Exploratory Analysis of Imbalanced Data** :
- **Session 2: Churn Prediction (Part I)** :
- **Session 3: Churn Prediction (Part II)** :
- **Session 4: Oversampling and Undersampling** :

This project was completed as part of the course Machine Learning for Data Science at University Paris Cit√©, France. Therefore the comments and analysis are written in French, except for the pdf report which has been translated.

# Repository Overview
This repository contains 4 Jupyter notebooks, one for each session, [ML_Seance1](ML_Seance1.ipynb), [ML_Seance2](ML_Seance2.ipynb), [ML_Seance3](ML_Seance3.ipynb), [ML_Seance4](ML_Seance4.ipynb) and an [original version of the report in French](ML_Report%20%28Original%20version%29.pdf) as well as a [translated version of the report](ML_Report%20%28Translated%29.pdf).
